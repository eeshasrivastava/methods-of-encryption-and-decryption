# methods-of-encryption-and-decryption
Our project is based on "Various methods of encryption and decryption using C++".
This program allows user to choose whether they want to encrypt/decrypt the string or the text file with the help of algorithms.
Note: A text file with extension “.txt” should exist in the system for the implementation of the code which is related to the text file encryption/decryption.
